## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=50E0u0ku1mclytos4rI-1hXK1cA

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3430u0kjIcScElzelfsnX9Ktf67
Your Rationale:  In this I tried to find colors with a muted background as to not hurt your eyes,
                  but still provides a good contrast with the text (mostly white in this case).

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:  http://paletton.com/#uid=13t0u0kdkfz8fpPbwkOiMcLnM9Y
Your Rationale:  The word rails to me invokes a gray feeling.  Like a train yard.  I don't think
                  I'd use this on it's own.  But it might work well with a variation of it's
